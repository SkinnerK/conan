Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.04,0:14:38.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, how did the culprit get out of the room after setting the trick up?

Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.19,0:15:04.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With this, it would be possible to make it look like suicide, wouldn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.28,0:15:08.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, placing the culprit will be difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.11,0:15:10.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's true...

Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.49,0:15:16.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.87,0:15:22.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because if the culprit didn't use the large book, the gap in the doorway wouldn't have been wide enough for them.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.22,0:17:00.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was simple compared with this one.
