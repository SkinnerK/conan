Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.38,0:06:10.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There was a rope around his neck with the other\Nedge of the rope being tied to a broken branch.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.14,0:06:17.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Which means it looks exactly like a suicide.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.06,0:06:23.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so I thought I could get information on those\Nstrange points from the employee that found the body.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.32,0:06:33.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, the owner of the inn said he met\Nwith the man wearing the red jacket.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.95,0:06:35.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When did that happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.04,0:06:39.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If I recall, he said it was around October five years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.46,0:06:47.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The story went that a man in a red jacket suddenly\Nentered the inn, found the owner, and said to him:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.42,0:06:53.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"I will give you 100,000 yen if you keep this\Nattach√© case and envelope safe for me."

Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.52,0:06:56.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.14,0:06:58.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,An attach√© case and an envelope?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.27,0:07:00.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.06,0:07:06.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He also said, "Give me back the attach√© case if I'm the\None that comes, and the envelope if it's anybody else."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.40,0:07:14.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, we can't say for sure that the man in the red\Njacket is the one whose body was found in the forest.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.66,0:07:22.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But that man made it clear by saying, "Don't forget my\Nred jacket and long hair," so they're probably the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.88,0:07:26.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And it seems he didn't come\Nback to retrieve it after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.21,0:07:29.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Now that you mention it, the body\Nis one of a man with long hair...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.92,0:07:31.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, maybe it's like this:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.84,0:07:37.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This man entrusted it to the inn owner five years ago\Nwhile saying, "I'll come retrieve it even if I die."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.56,0:07:39.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, when he returned one summer later...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.85,0:07:43.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And was traveling through the\Nforest, he committed suicide.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.48,0:07:46.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What a fool of a man!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.19,0:07:48.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He can't take it back if he's dead!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.36,0:07:52.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why the inn owner called\Non me to solve the mystery!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.99,0:07:58.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That man paid the owner to keep it quiet from the\Npolice, so that's why he stayed mum until now.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.58,0:08:00.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.66,0:08:01.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Say...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.29,0:08:05.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did nobody come to claim that attach√© case in the end?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.92,0:08:13.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, a day after the red-jacketed man entrusted it to the\Ninn, another man claiming to be his proxy appeared.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.09,0:08:18.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A suspicious guy with a hat, sunglasses and a beard.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.01,0:08:24.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The owner hesitated a little but handed over the\Nenvelope as instructed by the man in the red jacket.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.56,0:08:26.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.06,0:08:35.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The guy opened the envelope and, upon seeing\Nthe memo inside, tore it apart in anger...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.03,0:08:40.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And threw it in the garbage can in the lobby\Nand left the inn, never to be seen again.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.70,0:08:42.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What was written on this memo?
