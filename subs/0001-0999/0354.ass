Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.03,0:06:50.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I bet your mother didn't want you to know where she was.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.95,0:06:56.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So she used the top left postcard, since it would be hardest to figure out that this was the statue of Kanichi and O-Miya.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.95,0:07:01.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Probably she got this picture postcard because it was left unsold in the shop at a hotel or Japanese-style inn.
