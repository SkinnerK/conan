Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.96,0:07:50.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think those known to be helping us hide her are in danger of becoming targets of the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.30,0:07:58.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The issue now is how will we determine which of those three is their member disguised as a patient.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.06,0:08:05.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally, I would take the three of them, transfer them to another hospital, and interrogate them at length.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.19,0:08:07.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.19,0:08:11.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since our investigation isn't sanctioned by the Japanese police...

Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.74,0:08:17.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And two of them are just normal patients.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.04,0:08:25.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having said that, if we approach the suspects badly here, they will realize we're the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:28.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they would know it's likely that she's being held in this hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.63,0:08:29.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, then...
